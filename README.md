# 1HGJ#5 Entry

This is an entry for the [1 Hour Game Jam](http://weekjam.com/)  on May 15th 2015. Titled "Eyes of flight"
and backed by some incredibly bad math, the game is intended to be played with an Tobii EyeX
eye tracker in the "make cursor snap to eye fixation point" mode.

You try to keep flying by picking up looking at yellow things (or moving the mouse over it). :smiley:

The game is terrible and controls badly. It also looks amazing:
